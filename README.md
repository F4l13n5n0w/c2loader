# C2Loader

## This is used to generate a AV bypassed C2 loader from shellcode.

### Install MONO when using Linux
```
sudo apt install apt-transport-https dirmngr gnupg ca-certificates
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 3FA7E0328081BFF6A14DA29AA6A19B38D3D831EF
echo "deb https://download.mono-project.com/repo/debian stable-buster main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mono-official-stable.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install mono-complete
```

### Currently supporting the following C2 plateform (It is now should be able to support any C2 if shellcode is provided):

* Meterpreter
* Covenent
* Sliver
* Cobalt Strike test


### Feature

* Process Hollowing
* Behaviour detection bypass
* Random AES encryption
* Rewrite to use D/Invoke direct syscalls (up to test day, most common AVs can be bypassed: Windows defender, CS Falcon, Carbon Black, Red Canary, Cylance and McAfee)

### Guide

* miniloader_template is ideal for small shellcode, such as meterpreter shellcode generated by msfvenom, it has better AV byapss since it is not using a well known WIN32 API: ZwMapViewOfSection

### To Do

* Add bananameowloader for even better AV bypass
* Add InlineExecute-Assembly BoF support for Sliver
