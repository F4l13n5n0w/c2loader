# C2Loader

## This is used to generate a AV bypassed C2 loader from shellcode.

### Currently supporting the following C2 plateform:

* Meterpreter
* Covenent
* Sliver


### Feature

* Process Hollowing
* Behaviour detection bypass
* Random AES encryption

### Guide

* miniloader_template is ideal for small shellcode, such as meterpreter shellcode generated by msfvenom, it has better AV byapss since it is not using a well known WIN32 API: ZwMapViewOfSection

### To Do

* add support for CS shellcode
